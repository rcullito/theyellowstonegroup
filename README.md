The Yellowstone Group: A book I wrote during my time off from programming.


This is one of those none code repos, but as I always thought github was a nice place to incude "project work" in general 
I thought I would include a bit about my recent book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Yellowstone-Group-Robert-Culliton/dp/1977079849/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1518024325&sr=1-1&keywords=the+yellowstone+group)

Right now it is available on amazon via the link above, and soon to be released via an independent publisher. Most importantly I just
hope people read it, so if cost is any issue, hit me up at rob.culliton@gmail.com and I'll email over a pdf for free. 

Oh, and a description of what the books is about might help:

> In an effort to curb global warming, the innovators of tomorrow overshot the mark and now the Earth is cooling. 
> The ambitious have adjusted their sights to focus on adaptation to falling temperatures, 
> and a young engineer takes it upon himself to move from New York City to Wyoming in order to 
> develop solutions on the front lines. Torn between a quirky disposition and a stated desire for positive impact, 
> this is a bildungsroman set against a backdrop of mountains, visionaries, and a settlement of forgotten Mongolians; a 
> story about what is gained and what is taken when one yearns to believe that a small group can change the world.
