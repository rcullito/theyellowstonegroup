# The Yellowstone Group
The Yellowstone Group: A book I wrote during my time off from programming.

This is one of those non-code repos, but as I always thought github was a nice place to host "project work" in general 
I decided to include a bit about my recent book here.

If you're a fellow programmer like me (or if you're anything really) hopefully the issues of scale and
individuality matter to you. I'm not saying there are any right answers, but I do think some additional
thought is helpful before subscribing completely to the view that 1,000,000 active users are better than
having just a handful, or that following established practice is always preferable to taking one's own quirks
and running with them. This book was a welcome chance to explore different lines of thought I've heard and
seen over the course of my 20s mixed with a kind of overstated message about the environment.

"The Yellowstone Group"  was available for a few months earlier this calendar year (2018) so a tremendous thank you to
everyone who read it! I was fortunate to receive some thoughtful feedback and am currently working on another
revision which I hope will cut to the point more quickly while also providing a modicum of entertainment. 

If anyone has any questions or concerns, my email is `rob.culliton@gmail.com` and I'm always down to kick
around ideas. 

Oh, and a description of what the book is about might help:

> In an effort to curb global warming, the innovators of tomorrow overshot the mark and now the Earth is cooling. 
> The ambitious have adjusted their sights to focus on adaptation to falling temperatures, 
> and a young engineer takes it upon himself to move from New York City to Wyoming in order to 
> develop solutions on the front lines. Torn between a quirky disposition and a stated desire for positive impact, 
> this is a bildungsroman set against a backdrop of mountains, visionaries, and a settlement of forgotten Mongolians; a 
> story about what is gained and what is taken when one yearns to believe that a small group can change the world.
