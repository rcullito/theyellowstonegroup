# The Yellowstone Group
The Yellowstone Group: A book I wrote during my time off from programming.

This is one of those none code repos, but as I always thought github was a nice place to incude "project work" in general 
I thought I would include a bit about my recent book here.

If you're a fellow programmer like me, hopefully the issues of scale and individuality matter to you. I'm not saying there are any right answers, but I do think some additional thought is helpful before subscribing completely to the view that 1,000,000 active users are better than having just a handful, or that following established practice is always preferable to taking one's own quirks and running with them. This book was a welcome chance to explore different sides of these issues, and ideally it would be rewarding if others found in its pages some of the same struggles and contradictions inherent in startup life.  

Right now it is available on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Yellowstone-Group-Robert-Culliton/dp/1977079849/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1518024325&sr=1-1&keywords=the+yellowstone+group), and soon to be released via an independent publisher. Most importantly, I just
hope people read it, so if cost is any issue, hit me up at rob.culliton@gmail.com and I'll email over a pdf for free. 

Oh, and a description of what the book is about might help:

> In an effort to curb global warming, the innovators of tomorrow overshot the mark and now the Earth is cooling. 
> The ambitious have adjusted their sights to focus on adaptation to falling temperatures, 
> and a young engineer takes it upon himself to move from New York City to Wyoming in order to 
> develop solutions on the front lines. Torn between a quirky disposition and a stated desire for positive impact, 
> this is a bildungsroman set against a backdrop of mountains, visionaries, and a settlement of forgotten Mongolians; a 
> story about what is gained and what is taken when one yearns to believe that a small group can change the world.
